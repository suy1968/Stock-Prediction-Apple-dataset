- Simple to implement.
- Overfitting can be reduced by regularization
- Used to predict numeric values.
- Performance on linearly seperable datasets

**Linear Regression Cons**:
- Prone to overfitting.
- Sensitive to outliers
- Cannot be used when the relation between independent and dependent variable are non linear.
